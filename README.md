This repository contains a simple example of a common error in Rust: attempting to create multiple mutable references to the same variable.  The `bug.rs` file demonstrates the error, and `bugSolution.rs` provides a solution using techniques such as cloning or refactoring to avoid the issue.  Understanding mutable borrowing rules in Rust is crucial to writing safe and efficient code.
